            <p class="blog-post-meta">August 13, 2015 by Michael</p>

            <p>Just a quick note this time.  It looks like we have agreed to have the owners meeting on Saturday, August 15th at 5pm and the draft the following Saturday, August 22nd at 5pm also.  
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>I will have a link up to the <a href="https://clickydraft.com/draftapp/">ClickyDraft</a> online draft board for anyone that can't make the draft live posted after we determine the draft order at the meeting.</p>

            <br>

            <p>Only a week and a half left till the draft!  Good luck with your research.</p>

            <br>

            <p>See everyone soon,</p>

            <br>

            <p>Happy 4th of July to everyone!</p>

            <br>

            <p>The new season is approaching (not soon enough), and it is time to schedule an owners meeting to determine draft order and discuss any rule changes we want to consider.  With the season starting September 10th, the last weekend of August or the first weekend in September are going to be our options for the draft itself, leaving about six weekends open for the owners meeting.</p>

            <br>

            <p>I have set up two events on <a href="http://doodle.com/">Doodle</a> in order to try and figure out the best time for everyone.  Because anyone with the link can respond, I will send it to everyone via text or email, even though I doubt anyone else is looking at this page.</p>

            <br>

            <img src="../img/doodlephone.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Phone Screenshot">

            <br>

            <h3>Phone View</h3>
            <p>If you haven't used Doodle before, here is what it will look like if you pull it up on your phone.  There is a list of possible times for the event with a blue check mark next to it.</p>
              <ol class="bloglist">
                <li>If you can definitely make it at that time, click the blue check once and it will turn green.</li>
                <li>If it's not a great time for you, but you can make it if you have to, click it twice and it will turn orange.</li>
                <li>If you can't make a time click it three times until it turns red.</li>
                <li>After you have done this for all available times click save.</li>
              </ol>

            <br>

            <p>Try to pick a response for each time, as this will help us see which dates and times work for the most people.  You're not voting for which time you like best, you're just letting us know if you can or can't make a specific time.  It works by finding which time has the most overlapping number of people that can attend.  I'll be sending out links for both the draft and the owners meeting soon, so be on the lookout.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Have a great holiday weekend,</p>

          <div class="blog-post">
            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Welcome!</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">June 28, 2015 by Michael</p>

            <p>Welcome everyone to our new site!  While it will never replace our actual <a href="https://football.fantasysports.yahoo.com/f1/49426">league page</a>, I hope that eventually it will become complementary to it.  This is a learning project for me, so please bear with me as things are changed and hopefully improved as we go along.  It’s just a static site right now, but I hope to make it more interactive as I learn.  I would also love suggestions from all of you about what you would like to see here and constructive criticism about what is here already.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I primarily wanted a place where we can keep the history of our league recorded.  Unfortunately, because we moved from NFL.com the first season to Yahoo the second, we lost a lot of the scoring data.  This includes single game records and positional scoring records.  We lost this for last season as well, even though we still have access to Yahoo.  The archived information doesn’t include the record book from what I can see.  I had a vague idea of wanting to keep records early on and had saved standings and season scoring information in a spreadsheet and used that to put up what we have here.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I don’t want it to be just statistics and announcements though.  I would love to eventually have pictures of owners meetings, draft nights, and trophy presentations.  I would like to have a place where we can all contribute our own recollections of the formation of the league, fun stories, or accounts of some of the rivalries that have developed.  I have really enjoyed having this league over the past two seasons.  Part of it is enjoying fantasy football and the competition, but mainly it's being in the league with you guys.  As corny as it sounds, I have absolutely loved having the interaction and entertainment and competition with family members that I wouldn't have talked to nearly as often otherwise.</p>
            <br>
            <p>All of that being said, here is a rough outline of what I would like to do with this going forward:</p>

            <h3>During Preseason</h3>
            <p><ul class="bloglist">
              <li>Announcements</li>
              <li>Schedule owners meeting to discuss any league changes and determine draft order</li>
              <li>Schedule draft</li>
             </ul>
            <h3>During the Season:</h3>
            <ul class="bloglist">
              <li>Post here twice a week.  Previews and recaps of weekly games</li>
              <li>Update schedules, standings and records as we go along</li>
              <li>Get photos, stories and input from everyone to add to the site</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>No Timeline / As I Learn:</h3>
            <ul class="bloglist">
              <li>Improving design of the site</li>
              <li>More interactivity and functionality</li>
                <ul ul class="bloglist">
                  <li>Make tables interactive and sortable</li>
                  <li>Make profile pictures user customizable</li>
                </ul>
            </ul></p>

            <p>Your amazing profile pictures were painstakingly picked by me from what I could grab from your facebook pages or what I had around.  While I’m sure you love them as much as I do, feel free to send me replacements and I will get them updated.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I am looking forward to another great season with everyone.  Hopefully it'll actually be competitive this year.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The Reigning Champ,</p>
            <p>Michael</p>
